Today's episode is a showand tell


episode with none other than Kevin Rose.


He takes us through his entire AI


workflow and lets us in and a new


product that he's developed that he


hasn't shared anywhere and we learn


about how he thinks about building new


products, cloud code, versel, all the


tools he uses. So it's super super


fascinating. Kevin is just one of those


iconic entrepreneurs and to have an


inside look into his AI workflow and how


he's building products in this AI age is


absolutely fascinating. It got my


creative juices flowing. I think it will


get yours too. And if you stick around


to the end of the episode, you will


understand how to build products in the


AI age, how to think about it, and what


tools to be using. Enjoy the episode.


We got the one and only Kevin Rose on


the podcast. I'm super excited to have


him. He has been going down the AI


rabbit hole for a while now. And I


wanted Kevin to come on just to share,


you know, what are the tools he's using,


uh, some of the AI workflows that he


has. And he's just going to screen


share. Kevin, by the end of the this


episode, what do you think people are


gonna get out of it? Like, if they stick


around?


>> Yeah. Well, I certainly first, thanks


for having me on. It's I love the


content and everything you're producing.


It's so important right now, especially


with things moving so fast. Um but I


think at the end of it you will see that


things that are technically out of


bounds for you like things that you just


think that you cannot do are very much


possible as a solo engineer solo


designer and now we're finally at the


point where I'm not even calling it slop


anymore. Like they call the AI slop or


whatever it may be or however you want


to look at the code. It's damn good and


it's getting better by the week. And um


I think that you'll just I hope that


you'll be inspired to go build something


amazing because I'm going to show you


something that is a little mad sciency


weird and all over the place. And you'll


get to see kind of a a raw version of my


brain and how deep I go on some of this


stuff. Um, but I think that's the beauty


of it is is is this idea that we can go


build anything and often times when we


do it ends up being a a little bit of a


I don't know a sandbox that can be a


little too big and messy and then you


have to refine it back to something


that's actually usable. So I think that


the future engineer and the future


developer, the future product builder


here, it's not going to be uh what you


build as much as what you don't build,


if that kind of makes sense. because


it's going to be so easy to build


anything and everything. Um to pair it


back to something that's really usable,


I think is going to be the a real skill.


>> Yeah. The hard part is the clarity. Like


how do you get the clarity to know what


to build?


>> Uh at least that's that's that's what


I've been struggling with.


>> Yeah. And then that's actually rolls


right into the the project that I've


been kind of working on just for fun.


And um yeah, so I'm excited.


>> All right, let's get into it. Okay. So,


we can I'll show you kind of this, you


know, quote unquote vibecoded or let's


just call it coded project and I'll tell


you the inspiration and then um we'll


get into some of the the kind of dirty


details and how it functions and what's


possible as someone that kind of walked


into this uh thinking I actually just


asking myself can I pull this off? So,


um let me go ahead and do a little


screen share here.


All right. You should be able to see uh


TechMe up there, right?


>> Yep.


>> Okay. Awesome. So, first thing and and


hope we don't uh in the edit. This has


to make it in. I have nothing but a huge


amount of respect for Gabe and what he's


created in TechMe. Uh what I'm building


today is not meant to be a competitor. I


don't plan on launching it in its like


form. It was mainly uh a personal


curiosity of can I build something


that's on par or better than TechMe by


myself and call it like a week and see


what that would look like. And one of


the nice things about TechMe is for


those that don't know or for those that


are lightly familiar with it, it's been


around for a long time. Gab's been


building software since I was back in


2004, which is crazy. And we were both


kind of, you know, experimenting in


early social news and what that meant.


And what you see here is an aggregator


um that pulls from RSS and other


sources. I don't know all the sources


that he pulls from, but then also pulls


from social media as well. And when you


gather momentum, whether it be multiple


um news stories coming in or multiple


people tweeting about something or


talking about it socially, that is


considered signal and then that is


considered used uh as part of, you know,


ranking uh and showing you what's


prominent here. And so what what um what


you're seeing is actually visually the


higher an object is here, the more


weight it carries with a user because if


you come in here and you scroll down to


the bottom and you see something with


very little tweets on it, it doesn't


nearly carry as much impact as, you


know, something with 15 or 20 different


X posts underneath it. And so I like


what he's doing here. I think it's a


it's a really cool way to say, you know,


maybe you might recognize some names,


especially in tech, given how small the


ecosystem is, you can probably look


through this list and say, "Oh, I know


these the two or three people. If


they're talking about it, what are they


saying? And might I just hover over and


see what their comment was about a


particular story?" So, a lot to love


here. I mean, Gab's done a a great job


at at creating this, but I um have a


slightly different area of interest. A


lot of this is big tech news and I kind


of wanted to dive into like more of


what's going on in AI because AI is


moving just so fast. You know, how can I


slice slice this in really interesting


ways to find my version of this and this


is stuff that we're playing around with


at DIG with the reboot as well. So it


kind of goes handinhand with some of the


kind of exploration that we're doing in


a lot of these different areas. And so


my job these days um you know with


Alexis O'hane on at at Dig is we have


Justin as a CEO who runs kind of like


the day-to-day and and builds out you


know the Reddit competitor version of


Dig. And then we have, you know, me that


I'm kind of more in the labs area where


I'm pushing on the edges of ideas and


saying what might we do and does any of


this make sense to roll back into the


main product. And then Alexis is kind of


just a overarching, you know, great


ideas. So much depth of knowledge


around, you know, both micro and macro


communities and how they work and how


they scale and what to do and not do and


some of the missing tools and that's


kind of how it all comes together. So,


long story short, this is what I built.


Um, so first thing I want to show you is


that um there's going to be some errors


here because it's been a minute since I


have actually uh done the whole um


actually touch this codebase. But what


you see here is I have 63 sources of


information coming in. And so these are


from just your classic RSS feeds. Yes,


RSS still does exist. Uh, a lot of sites


do break RSS and so there are actually


ways to go and add in um kind of


scrapers that will create dynamic RSS


for you even though RSS is no longer


around. Um, but you can see here um it's


a bunch of different uh RSS uh uh


sources that are coming in here. Some of


them are Reddit, some of Techrunch, but


all largely uh techreated.


So, because this hasn't been run in a


while, we've got a lot of jobs that have


to run in the background here to go and


rec crawl all of this. So, I haven't run


this project in a few days. And so, it's


essentially going out and hitting all


these different uh RSS feeds, pulling in


and ingesting all that information,


bringing it into the into the engine,


and then expanding upon. And there's


orchestrators and there's ways to


actually go in and and resolve certain


chunks of information and find out more


about individual stories. And I'll get


into that in a second, but we're playing


a little bit of catch-up here. So, if


the news stories for some reason don't


look exactly fresh fresh, you'll know


why. But they they'll be pretty damn


close here in a couple minutes. It just


needs to go and uh and do this this


catch up. So, um going back to the RSS


feeds here. So, okay, great. We've got


sources. Now, what do we do? Well,


sources lead to articles. And um when we


go over to articles here, you can see


now it's starting to pull in some of


these articles in real time. So, we've


got Mac Rumors 13 minutes ago. And then


we've got a little status check here.


And the status check is really what


happens once the article is pulled in to


the system like how do we process that


article? How do we figure out what to do


with that article? So, you know, 21 25


minutes ago, 29 minutes ago, The Verge 9


to5. And so we're pulling in and uh


saving all of this in a Postgress


database. And then we're also going in


and doing things like figuring out who


the authors are. And this comes down to


author reputation. And so we can start


look taking a look at different authors


that are here. And I can click on you


know any of these authors and actually


um you know see what articles they've


actually contributed as well. Um so you


know this individual uh author here and


what all of the articles that they


published. Um, but what's more


interesting here is actually what we're


doing with these articles. So, what


happens is


is as I start to pull in these articles,


and this is where it gets pretty crazy


because, you know, I didn't have this um


I I didn't really know I understood


technically how to pull this off in


terms of the the tools that would be


required, but I couldn't write the code


to do it. And so once we go in and we


take an individual article, let me just


get into an actual um an article itself


here.


See if that will take me into the actual


that might pop me out to Okay, here we


go. So here's a article right that now


that just came in talks about the new


air tags that just got announced and um


this came in from Mac Rumors. It's got


an ID associated with it. So I was


setting all this up with in the


database. It has a cluster membership


associated with it which we can get into


in a little bit but also it has a


pipeline status and so what happens is


is it comes in via RSS I hit I framely


and I framely gives me back additional


metadata about it so like title


description um sometimes it can pull in


even additional kind of deeper context


about it article data things like that


and I want to store all of that that's


really important for me to have that


rich data and then I can see that Gemini


has been run against it as well which we


can get into in for uh in a minute for


as to the reason why. And so the winner


has been resolved, the TLDDR has been


generated and the embedding has been


done. So the winner is basically saying,


okay, there are a bunch of different


factors here that might come in. Like


for example, if I'm pulling this in with


RSS,


I might not get a description there


because RSS sometimes is like kind of


truncated. I might not get a really good


description. But if I go and I hit I


framely, then I might actually get a


longer and better description. or if I


go and hit firecrawl, I actually might


get the full actual paragraph of or the


full body of the article. So what we do


is we have a judge that looks at it and


says, "Okay, which is the best of these


three that came in and pick a winner and


the winner is the one that actually gets


stored to the database." So that's what


winner means. And we do that on a


variety of different things. We I don't


know why we say we. I I do that. I'm the


one that actually ever coded this thing.


Um so basically we can see here that for


this particular uh story it did not have


I think we got a failure. We're coming


from Mac rumors. The winner was actually


uh Gemini. So Gemini is used as a last


resort. So you can see here fire crawl


returned a 403. We had a hard air there.


Um I framely we had some kind of low


quality signals. We got a successful


crawl but we had low quality signals.


And then RSS um good it's used as a


fallback. Good amount of characters


here. We can see what the actual uh


summary of that content was when we got


ours out of RSS. But as you can see


here, it's actually a pretty crappy RSS


poll. There's not a whole lot of data


there. You know, it just doesn't look


that well or it doesn't look that good.


So what we did is we hit Gemini and


said, "Hey, Gemini, turn on your ground


truth. Turn on your search. Go out and


figure out what is like what is this


actually about?" Right? And often times


they won't come out and say this, but


they kind of crawl the article and give


you back what the article actually says.


They might reward it a little bit, but


it's largely what the article says. And


I can prove that because they can you


can do that with Reddit articles and


things like that where most all


everything will fail because Red's so


hardcore about blocking it. Does that


Greg does that makes sense so far?


>> That does make sense. I just have one


question around like why did you choose


firecrawl and I framely especially and


can you just explain what th what they


do for people who aren't familiar with


those services?


>> Yeah, for sure. So, um let's go ahead


and um take the actual article here and


so uh I'll show this tab instead. And so


you can see this is the Mac Rumors um


article right


>> now. If I take this Mac Rumors article


and I copy and paste it and then I go


into I framely here, I can paste in a


URL, any URL. And obviously I'm doing


this via API, but I just want to show


you how it works. And I hit check URL.


And what it's going to do is it's going


to give me this this card back. So it's


almost like those cards that you see on


on X, you know, where you get a piece of


rich media, you get the best possible


image, get a beautiful title, nice


little description here. Sometimes it's


a little bit longer. And then I can just


jump in here and look at the JSON and


see like okay what did we get here and


kind of expand out and say did we get a


high quality logo like you know like I


can look for and parse through all of


this and try and find highquality data


and then also I mean it's called I frame


largely because if there is an embedded


piece of media you also get all of those


embed codes as well. So you get all of


it. So, I can actually take, and the


reason I like Gemini is because they're


tied in with uh YouTube, obviously, and


I can get transcripts back from full


YouTube um uh videos, which is great for


vector embeddings when I want to figure


out what it's actually about. Okay, does


that make sense?


>> Crystal clear.


>> Okay. And so, you can consider Firecrawl


to be a very similar thing. It is a


little bit more on the crawling side.


So, a little bit more fine-tuned around


crawling. they have some AI um uh


aspects to it as well where AI will


actually try and go out and figure out


how the best way to kind of scrape the


content. And then uh yeah, lastly with


Firecrawl, I think it's just they have


some stealth modes that you can turn on.


So some of these news sources, they get


really picky about what what they're


allowed to be crawled and so you can


kind of like hide and turn on stealth


mode and then get to the actual data.


And it's not my in my intention is not


to like, you know, get around their ads


or do something like evil here. It's


really just to figure where's the signal


and and to start to cluster these things


together. So, back to and by the way,


the working title for this is my my


little thing that I code on nights and


weekends. It's called nylon. It's my


little incubator that I I work on. So,


that's uh that's why you see nylon up


here in the corner. Um, all right. So,


scrolling back down, we can see that.


Okay. So, here's the resolve content I


framely. We got the picture. We got the


author, we got the summary, and here's


the main content from Gemini. So, we use


that. Gemini won here. I framely won the


summary. Gemini won the actual U main


content. And then what I hit is I hit


GPT5 mini largely because it's fast as


hell and cheap and you don't it's very


it's quite smart. Uh, Anthropic has a


handful of models that also fall in this


camp. I mean they all do you know it's


really at the end of the day uh because


I'm using uh vector embeddings uh from


um you know OpenAI it's just when I have


one model provider I just stick with it


and unless I really need to bounce


around which I did for the actual Gemini


crawl and understanding of other things.


So I try to keep it as simple as


possible but sometimes you need multiple


models and I will say Verscell's AI


gateway is a great way to kind of code


once and just flip a model on on the go.


So, um, highly recommend checking out


Versela AI gateway as a way to quickly


swap models, uh, rather than having to


recode it. All right. So, I want a


TLDDR. That's important. I just want


that human readable so you can see that.


So, I want a TLDDR that is a vector


TLDDR. And so, for people that don't


don't know, um, vector embeddings are


really interesting. I had never worked


with them before. I'd heard about them.


I understood technically how they


function. But the point is that if you


take a keywordrich and kind of deep


understanding piece of content, you can


create mathematical representations of


that content and embed these with open


AI and store them in Postgress by using


a vector extensions. They're actually


stored in your database as those pieces


of math. And when you apply some of


these clustering algorithms on top of


them, they get really good at nuanced


information where keyword search would


completely fall down. So the old school


ways back in the day in 2004 when I


launched, you know, dig as a social news


site, if you search for, you know, Apple


um releases, whatever, it's it's find


it's looking the word Apple. was looking


for release and it's looking for


whatever it was back then that they were


doing like a iPod or something, right?


And it would it just does it based on


just can I find that text in the


database and if so show me back the


article. The beautiful thing about what


we have today with our understanding of


linguistics and around using vector


embeds and algorithms on top of that is


that you can say there is a difference


even though they're both have the same


type of keywords but there is a huge


difference between Apple sues Google and


Google sues Apple and that is impossible


to do with keyword search because you're


not understanding at a deep level what's


going on here, right? So anyway, this is


a very rich purposely rich uh longer


form version of the TLDDR used just for


for uh vector embeddings. And then I


also wanted to create some key points


here that we can use to feed into other


models later when we're comparing the


difference between articles when we see


multiple articles starting to get


clustered together. And then I don't use


this, but I asked AI like, "Hey, write


me like a spicier title, like a title


that people might click on more, find


more interesting, and just to kind of


rewrite the title." And and Techbeam


does this, too. Like when you go to the


front page of Techbeam, it's not the


title of the article, it's like actually


what their editors chose to write. So, I


just wanted to see how this looked. And


then I wanted to put it in one of uh


three different categories. um tech core


and a couple other categories largely


because there's a lot of stuff that come


through these tech feeds especially when


you add in like Forbes and some of these


others where it's like you know does not


relate to actual core tech or AI are the


things I care about and I just wanted to


put them in a bin and so here's the


embedding I'm using the large model uh


from OpenAI uh you can see when it was


generated when it was done and then uh


just some information about making sure


that we don't rec crawl the article and


have all that so that's done Okay, any


questions so far? We got one article


into the system.


>> Uh, no, keep going. Keep going.


>> Okay, so now let's talk about clusters.


So clusters are well actually let me


show show off one other thing. So how


does this actually work? So how does


that all that work on the back end,


right? And there's a couple different


ways that you could do this. You could


say I want to kind of um write this in


Nex.js and I want to have this just be a


function. And if you want to get a


little bit more fancy, you could say,


"Okay, I'm using Superbase, so I'm going


to throw on uh some cron jobs there and


fire off these things, and I don't know


if they fail or, you know, there's


there's a lot of um it gets a little


dicey here because often times things


bad things can happen like you can have


a RSS feed that gets blocked


temporarily. You could have timeouts,


you could have a model that actually


doesn't complete. Um, and so I need


durability around a lot of this stuff,


right? And so what I do for that,


actually, let me just do a screen share


again, is for the durability side, okay,


I use a service called uh, trigger.dev.


And so I like trigger.dev because what


it does is it allows me to create um


these functions and they're all


TypeScript that live in the cloud and


that they are fired off either when I


call them from my app or at a certain


cadence. And so there are um these


orchestrators that will go in here. You


can see the expansion orchestrator


that's when it go wants to go in and


expand a story and actually see you know


more more information about it. You can


see clustering different uh things here.


Here's my firecrawler. Here's my Gemini.


Here's my I framely. So, anytime I fire


something off to be enriched, I actually


create this new little micro instance


that goes out and runs on its own. You


can see here the ones that are


executing. See the little spinners here.


So, these are all kind of running in


real time. And then you can see the


compute uh charge to go off and execute


these and then how many milliseconds


they they took. Now the thing that's


interesting here is um you actually get


to see the whole chain in which


everything went down here. So you can


see okay I was looking to kind of


resolve a story ID uh locked in


candidates I got you know one picture


one summary u did it resolve the winners


yes Gemini was the winner here uh it was


published at and then it it finished the


whole process. The nice thing about this


is that if something fails, I get


retries for free. And so I will


automatically, you know, if an AI tlddr


for a vector embedding, which is very


important as bu we're building clusters,


fails once, fails twice, it will


continue to retry as, you know, and


automatically spin up these instances


and try again. uh and then will report


back to me via Sentry or any other type


of monitoring software that I have on


the back end that oh I had a failure why


did this actually happen right and so I


like that because a couple things if I'm


developing this locally and I don't have


this on production my data continues to


be enriched in the database and so I can


continue to develop before I actually


deploy to production so when I'm running


this locally like I'm showing you here


it's like it's it's if it's functioning


and continuing to build things out.


There's a few things that I are still


tied locally that I need to catch up on


uh to fire this back up because I just


don't want to be burning through cash


for for no reason if I'm not using it.


But um yeah, so does that make sense?


>> Yeah. I also think if I remember


correctly, trigger.dev is open source,


so we like that. I also think it's


relatively cheap.


>> Oh yeah, it's really inexpensive. like


it's something like 10 15 bucks a month


for 50 tasks or something last I


checked.


>> It's well I mean I I think we look when


we looked on there we were actually


seeing the per per I mean I'm running


thousands and thousands of these and you


know yeah it's like under $100 a month


and that's I mean when I say thousands I


mean like per day.


>> Yeah.


>> So it's it's it's not it obviously if


they're going to be super you you can


choose your instance type like with


anything else. These are really


lightweight non-computational kind of


tasks to do. Some people use trigger for


things like um you know using ffmpeg to


do encoding and and you know things of


that nature that are going to require a


larger instance are obviously going to


be more more pricey. So it really


depends on like everything in in cloud


on on the workload. Right.


>> Totally. Yeah. I just don't want people


to see this and be like oh my god this


is probably thousands of dollars a


month. It's like shockingly inexpensive


for what it is. Yeah. And the other


thing I was going to tell you is that um


Verscell now has something called


workflows that they've launched in beta


that are basically it's for free and it


is trigger.dev for free. Um but it's


part of the the Verscell ecosystem if


you're in in into that ecosystem.


>> But um they're kind of these it's a way


to monitor, retry and have these long


working tasks as you know with edge


functions like that's been the


challenge, right? like you don't really


get a whole hell of a lot of time uh and


and things get stale. So anyway, this is


nice. Uh I like it. It's um yeah, you're


right though. It is an extra expense,


but um I think you can it is relatively


inexpensive for this type of task. Um


all right, so back to the clusters. So


now what we've we've done is we've run


an algorithm on top of that. We've got


all the vector embeds and we're starting


to build clusters. So as you can see


here, uh this is today. A I don't know


that everything's caught up. It looks


like we've enriched Oh, yeah. We're


close. 2284 of 2,288 stories have been


so 99.8% has been enriched in the last


24 hours, meaning that they've gone


through that entire pipeline of that uh


ones that were more or less failures


that we actually had to reach out to


Gemini and and get some extended data


from them. 353 stories were done there.


And you can see here we're starting to


get some actual weight. So 105 sources


reported on this EU investigation into X


over Grock uh uh generated sexual


images. Nvidia invests uh two billion


into debtridden coreweave 47 stories and


you're starting to get something that


looks kind of like a tech memeish type


feed. And then obviously you can slice


and dice this in a variety of different


ways. But this is where it gets even


crazier. So I promised you crazy stuff.


This is where we go down the rabbit


hole. So let's just take this idea of um


coreweave and Nvidia investing uh 2


billion. So we'll click on that cluster


and now we have 47 uh stories uh nine


were done via RSS and 38 discovered. So


what does that mean? That means that


when I see enough signal and I consider


that three or more RSS stories talking


about the same thing, I then hit search


APIs. You could hit Brave Braves uh


search API. Um, I use a Tavly search API


and you can say go out and find me other


stories outside of my RSS uh, ecosystem


that may match this and bring them in.


So, I can expand the scope and see is


this a broader story that has more


context that I'm just not seeing because


of my finite set of RSS articles. Does


that make sense?


>> Absolutely.


>> Okay. So, and then I'm looking at


there's average distance between


articles and similarities. This is all


part of this this algorithm right here


that I'm using for the clustering. Um,


so first story started four hours ago,


last minutes was 13 minutes minutes ago.


So then I created something called the


gravity engine. And so this is kind of


like a a editorial type score and then


it has actually it votes on it on how


important this story is generally


speaking. And I rate these in a few


different buckets here like the impact


uh another one called this it's gravity


which we can get into the confidence


ratio that this is pertains to


technology and the things that I'm


interested in and then this is all the


stories that it's evaluated and then


here's a little matrix here that I've


had built out where you can see u you


have an impact and then you have gravity


and it's in the high high area here


viral potential and how bubble size like


how big this will eventually get how


many people will you talk about it


within tech is 60% % uh early trend like


a growing trend is 75% intellectual


gravity is 86% and impact is 88%. And so


a total uh editorial vote of 85%. And


then we can get into the uh the the


rubric here which is uh so these are the


impact uh dimensions. So x-axis drivers


are industry impact. So it's 90%. So the


massive $2 billion investment solidifies


corewave's position as a key neo cloud


provider intensifying competition with


hypers scale scalers. Critically Nvidia


is also launching its Vera CPU as a


standalone product directly challenging


Intel and AMD in the data center market.


Uh consumer impact low 10%. This is


negligible for consumers. So rated that


actionability do I need to actually do


anything here? Is this for a general


audience? Can I take action? 30%.


uh said some action for investors maybe


but that's kind of it and then the risk


and urgency like do I need to act on


this which would be like okay there's a


911 iOS patch that you need to apply to


your phone or something right that would


be pegged at like 99% risk and urgency


um and then the the Y uh drivers here


are intellectual uh gravity drivers


which is how novel is this which is very


important to me because I want high and


I'm not I haven't fine- tuned this in


because it's saying how novel is for


today. But in reality, what I want is


novelty is applied against the longer


horizon timeline because one of the


things that's really fun is if you go


back and you look at the first time uh


on uh hacker news when Bitcoin was


mentioned, everyone was like, "Ah, this


is stupid blah blah blah." But if if I


would have found that in here, the


novelty would have been off the charts.


And that's important to me because


oftent times the largest things that we


do in tech and that we see evolve that


turn into these blockbuster things over


time seem very silly when we first hear


about them or so odd or different. And


that's the signal as both a builder and


investor that I want to find as early as


I possibly can. Right? So that that's


that's one that I care about deeply. uh


technical depth um you know second order


potential


uh builder relevance this was important


to me on the AI side I want to know how


uh important like as a someone that is


building in tech how much should I pay


attention to this uh entertainment value


which uh didn't have a lot of that and


then I've got some cross cutting signals


here signal to noise ratio viral


potential and early trend detection as


well um and then I added in some other


uh like I could these judges that just


sit here and kind of walk through this


which is you know what's the PR fluff


risk like how much of this is just a PR


thing because a lot of this can be you


know we'll see 20 or 30 and I can see


this it's it's really crazy um you can


tell I can detect when something is a


paid sponsorship even when sometimes


people aren't calling it out as such


which is like really scary and illegal


because I will see I can detect the


similarity and distance difference


between the vectors of the published


content between the news articles and


they're all released with plus or minus


an hour of each other and they're all t


they're all hitting the same major key


points and it's just like AI reworking


the paid sponsorship and I'm just like


it's pretty effed up like you know and


I'm like starting to find this stuff you


know it's just like wow so this is this


is what I do at night Greg I'm I'm I'm


embarrassed but this is what I do at


night


>> so just a question on this whole this


whole feature because like when I didn't


expect it to be this


full-fledged


like onpoint like is this something that


you sketched out on paper and built it


or are you like working with


>> you know AI as your co-founder to kind


of help you come up with this like walk


me through the product management piece


of this.


Yeah, I mean I I I I'm very much someone


that that builds based on gut instinct


and for me 99.9% of the features that I


create and and don't get me wrong


there's a lot of stuff I would cut out


here now you know because I would


consider like ah I didn't like that


should probably cut that out like source


distribution is a great one like we can


get into but um


I started was like okay let's crawl RSS


okay let's just do that let's throw


images up let's get as much rich data as


we


Let's do a very basic clustering


algorithm even before we put in vector


embeds. What does that look like? How


does it feel? And then I just was like,


well, what is TechMine not doing that I


I really care about? And and that led to


my personal curiosity around novelty of


of objects. How can I detect these


trends before they become big? You know,


all these things where I was just like,


I'm not seeing that anywhere else, so I


should just build it, right? And so it's


one feature at a time. So what you're


seeing here actually is like I would say


each of these things that you're seeing


is probably a day or two of just being


like well let's see if this will work


and what it looks like and then putting


it and then you know kind of using in


today's tools what I would do is I would


just you know use compound engineering


on cloud code and do a workflow and say


this is the idea that I have um actually


I probably would well it depends on how


big of idea. If it's a minor feature


tweak, I would just do it that way. If


it's something bigger that I needed to


flesh out that had technology that I


didn't know


um what the right choice was, then I


would use AI is more of a sparring


partner on that side. So, I'll give you


a great example. There are probably 10


competing clustering algorithms that you


can use for news. And hell, if I know


which one's the best, right? And so, I


actually took the top two that it


recommended for what I was trying to do.


And you you don't what you see here at


the top of this URL is you see clusters


V2. And the reason it says V2 is because


the second one ended up being better


than the first one. The first one no


longer exists. And so it's a lot of kind


of like just going down that rabbit hole


and saying, "Well, let's let's try these


things out." And and sometimes I would


immediately realize that was the wrong


direction and just actually just


uncommit that last whole GitHub reo repo


or that commit and and PR that I spent


four hours on and just chunk it and


throw it away all together and be like


well that was four hours lost but at the


same time I want to learn something new


and that's that's all of that's all of


building. All building is is failure


after failure and just and that and


failure is awesome because it's just


admitting that you've learned something


new. So many people beat themselves up


over failure and I I don't see it that


way. I just see it as like that's


failure is like it's the best part. That


means the next time it's going to be a


little bit better, you know? So anyway,


>> I'm really interested in the this whole


concept of like uh testing products on


synthetic audiences. I don't know if you


saw this, but you know, a few weeks ago,


I think Toby from Shopify launched a


feature where it was like you launch


your e-commerce store, but like based on


synthetic AI audiences, here's how they


would perform. Here's how your


conversion rate would look like. Here's


the products that they would click into


based on these personas. And I think


that's like that's sort of the direction


we're probably going to head in. So


before you like publish something, you


know, before you publish an ad, you have


some certainty that it's going to work.


Before you publish,


>> right,


>> uh an article, you know that, you know,


people are going to be clicking into it,


>> right? Yeah. I I I think there is so


many domains where that makes a lot of


sense. Um and and Toby's obviously just


a freaking genius and so brilliant.


>> Um what I do that's slightly different


and I would I'd be all for that type of


thing, but is I build for myself. I


think we're entering into this era of of


personal software, right? Like if


there's a workout app that you don't


like because the the buttons placement


doesn't doesn't do it for you or it


doesn't track one key core metric, like


you just build your own, right? And like


that's going to be the norm in, you


know, if it isn't already, it's going to


be the norm in like six months from now,


right? And then the question is, how


many people are there like you that also


care about said thing, right? And so


when I'm building this particular slice


of the news or the industry and we


haven't even gotten into the


understanding of who's touching things


because I think one of the things that


um that that has done really well in


tech is that social touch of like you


know when Mark Andre touches something


with a tweet or what you know how much


more credibility and weight does that


add to it even more so than Bloomberg or


Wall Street Journal or business insider


writing about something right so that's


yet another thing that needs to be baked


in here as well But then, you know, if I


enjoy it, the nice thing about this


whole thing is this was, you know, maybe


$300 in AI credits or something, you


know, to go build this whole thing. And


I could stand this up, cash the crap out


of it, meaning like so that it's


performant and and just put it out there


and everyone would be like, "Okay, if


I'm also into the geeky things that


Kevin is, I will use this, too." And


that might be a thousand people, might


be 100,000 people, no one knows. But


also at the same time, like that's okay.


Like if you if you have 500 people that


really love what you've created, I get a


lot of value and joy out of that. And


it's like we we think in numbers now on


the internet in terms of, you know,


millions and billions of people. But in


reality, if you like went outside your


house and there were 500 people standing


like cheering you on, you'd be like, I'm


the biggest rock star in the freaking


world, right? So we lose this


perspective of what it means, what


success means and and so I just I hope


that we can all agree and and just


realize it doesn't have to we don't have


to swing for the fences. So yeah, so I I


just you know that's I think what I'm so


excited about this is it's democratizing


code quality or coding for everyone. And


I was a computer science uh major. I


dropped out and I didn't know why and I


was really slow and I could understand


the core concepts but I didn't know why


I couldn't just do it as fast as my my


my everyone I was working with in my my


class and just six months ago I found


out that I have something called


aphantasia which is this inability to


have a mind's eye so when like people


close their eyes they and they say


picture an apple um or like you know the


famous one of like when you're trying to


go to sleep like like sheep keep jumping


over a fence or some like that. I


always thought they were joking, you


know? I didn't know that you could


actually close your eyes and envision


things. And so because of that, you


know, things like how to handle proper


syntax and on on on and code and like


all the things I was trying to beat into


my brain, the retention just wasn't


there. Somehow the core concepts stick


with me and the and the creativity. I've


always had that in abundance, which is


great. But uh but yeah and now like the


AI will fill in the deficiencies


wherever they are for you which is just


beautiful.


>> So I also dropped out of CS school uh


only had three classes left and I was


the same way in the sense that for me


I wasn't uh I couldn't get the last 10%.


So, like I couldn't get the code to


compile because there was like I had I


had 92% of it there, but there was, you


know, an integer missing here, a


variable missing there.


>> And what's cool is nowadays,


you know, of course, it's nice to know


that stuff, but if you're just trying to


get something out the door and to get


feedback from people, you know, let


Claude Code figure that out for you.


>> Yeah. Exactly. And the other thing too I


I I I think that is lost on a lot of


people that I see on social media around


what you know quote unquote vibe coding


means is they say well great and this


has been the complaint for a while vibe


coding is buggy it's not performant


it'll fall over under weight blah blah


blah I would argue


those are great problems to have the


hardest thing to do is to find something


that somebody actually wants to use


right like that's the hard problem if I


have something that I vibe coded and I


launch it and if it crashes under the


weight of 50,000 people beating my door


down because it's the the next best


thing, I guarantee you I can find you


engineers to work on that and scale it,


right? And so I I I don't think that


should be a reason why we we kind of


like I like it because you get more


shots on goal, right? Like I don't have


to look at the code. It's not because


like you, yes, I can jump into a


component in Typescript and and be like,


"Okay, I I kind of see what it's doing


here." You know, I can we can we can do


that. It's slow, but I can do that. But


that's not the point. I don't care right


now. I'd rather see actual humans using


it and saying, "Yeah, Kevin, this is so


cool. I want you to formalize this a


little bit more. Make sure it does


scale. And if if that comes in the form


of usage, then I'll find the find the


right engineers to to take my my kind of


scribble code and and make it real and


performant. And and honestly, compound


engineering has already been amazing and


that it's it's finding a bunch of stuff


and and making things more performant


for me on the fly.


>> So for this particular project, you're


going to put it up like success. I'm


just trying to think like success.


Success looks like what?


>> Well, it doesn't look like anything. I


might never launch this. It's like I I


might put together a little one pager


that's just like the best AI stories and


shown by the things that I care about


like novelty and impact or whatever it


may be or you know there's just I I


realize that you've got Product Hunt


which is kind of people that have


already launched things. You've got um


you know TechMe which is fantastic at


overarching big news you know coreweave


$2 billion like that's a techme story


all day long right and then you've got X


which is just a flood of stuff that's


coming at us so hot and heavy and it's


just like okay well where do I decide to


spend my time like we were just talking


about this before the the podcast uh


started you're like oh have you play


with this you play that and I'm like ah


you know cuz It's like you get so


there's so much coming at you. I want


this thing to eventually, if it ever


sees the light of day, what I wanted to


do is to say, Kevin, this is important


to you because it maps to you. these


very important people have touched it


and said it's worth your time and it's


passed that threshold to where now you


should go install it, play, have fun and


learn about it because otherwise I'm


just going to be and sadly because of my


ADHD I'm going to be bouncing around too


much to even get anything done. So


that's that's my hope. But yeah, that's


so you can see there's a lot of other


features we can get in here that we


won't have to. But it's um you know it


it this is me playing to see cuz a


perfect product here actually would be


to cut 90% of these features and just


find the 10% that really mean something


to me and a lot of people and launch it


as a standalone single page website.


Right? And that's what all but this is


the messiness of it all. And I I just


want to show people that like for me


what I do is I put everything on the


table. All the stuff on the table. All


the stuff that I would never show


anybody like the the the distance and


similarity scores between two stories.


Maybe I would show that. But it get it


all out there and then decide to cut and


and go in there with that kind of


director or editor's cut and start


making and start trimming trimming


trimming trimming down to where you


eventually get something that's really


usable and useful to to folks.


One feature which I would love to see on


something like this would be I'm just


thinking out loud like if I was a PM on


this product I would be like what is the


mechanic to bring people back? Uh so if


you go to go to ideabrowser.com


>> so I built this uh it started off as


like a lead magnet actually. Um


>> yeah I've I've seen this by the way.


This is like a very famous thing now


that you built.


>> And so basically the idea was the like


the first the lead magnet started off as


here's a database of 30 ideas I would


build today.


>> Yeah.


>> And then you know it was like put in


your email to get the access to the


database. And then it was like okay how


about what we do to make it more fun is


almost like you remember group on let's


do like instead of a product a day an


idea of the day and then the mechanic is


the email every single day you know we


get a 50% open rate people open up the


email


>> and it's grown you know very very fast


through that way so I wonder you know if


I'm building what you're building n you


know nylon if it does see the light of


day it's like what is the mechanic to


get people back to the website.


>> Yeah, I mean in in my mind the at least


for um for for news in general, it is


relevance to the to the end user. You


know, if if if it is discovering stuff


that you are missing or you have


overlooked and it's saving you time and


energy because it's saying, you know,


it's presented in a visual way like I'll


give you an example. if you were on a


conference call today and you had you


know uh let's call it like just like the


some leaning minds in tech if Sam Alman


and Mark Andre and like a handful of


other people in AI said hey um you know


Greg I think you should go check this


out and play with it there's a good


chance by that afternoon you would be


like installing it and and messing


around with it right and so visually I


would have to say there here are a


thousand signals that came in today, how


can I show you the five things that have


launched or that are in beta that are in


GitHub that are worth your time and map


to your interests as well, right? So, I


would probably go in and pull your last


100 or 500 exposts and and look at how


you interact and and and create, you


know, vector representations of who you


are as an individual and then also try


and get a little a little bit more


custom so that it maps to you. So if


you're very much into robotics, you


would see a bunch of amazing kind of


robotics information being presented to


you across a variety of different


fronts. So you know, you would see it


both in terms of things that are being


talked about on X and also things that


are being talked about on Product Hunt


or things that are be talked about on


Hacker News or, you know, Reddit or any


number of sources of the new dig or you


name it. So I don't know. I I I really


don't I think at the end of the day for


a consumer app um you know it has to


come down to am I finding something on


useful from this site or service that I


don't see anywhere else and is it


helping me save time and energy uh and


the answer may be no and then guess what


it's it cost me $500 and I flush it down


the drain and onto the next thing


>> you know like I I've got another one I


could show you if we have time don't


have time do we have two minutes


>> yeah let's do Right.


>> Okay. So, this one is is like December


15th. So, December uh 15th of so 12


years ago, I posted this idea that um


you could have a blog where you can


actually see the person in the


background in real time, but it's


blurred out, but it gives you a sense of


kind of presence that they were actually


there. And I was I'm still kind of


enamored with this idea especially


because we're entering into a world like


there me there I am like inputting in uh


information or typing as I'm typing but


we're we're we'reing entering into this


world where we don't even know if


there's another human on the other side


of it. I think that's just going to get


worse and worse over time. And so you


know I like fullon built this in uh


clawed code and now I have it you know


completely running and I can I can just


show it to you real quick. Uh, let's see


here. Just pull it up. Um,


>> while you're pulling that up, it just it


strikes me that there's a bunch of good


ideas from, for example, 12 years ago


that could be recreated today.


>> Oh, 100%.


>> Right.


>> Yeah. I mean, there were things that


were just either


so much of this is just right idea at


the right time, you know, and and some


of it was not technically possible.


these crazy ideas that we had or some of


it is even richer now that we can bolt


on AI and make it you know cooler and


different in some unique way. So there


are a lot of things that I feel will see


the light of day again but slightly


modified uh because it the cost to do so


is is is next to nothing you know which


is which is great. So, what wasn't


possible back then was real-time video


compression uh in the browser. And the


reason I say that is uh the prototype I


built 12 years ago, the issue would have


been that you uploaded raw video to the


site and then you blurred it after the


fact and which meant a user could go


trim away the CSS and actually see that


person in a very awkward kind of


position or whatever and like maybe an


environment where they were like looking


for a little bit of blur privacy. And so


now this is like all done uh in real


time. So what you're seeing now is it's


actually recording me. It's so like


hello world. Um this


is a test. And then I can just kind of


move my arms around like this a little


bit. Get a little movement and and


please like this is the V.01


alpha of this whole thing. Um and then


hit submit. And it's doing some horrible


broken math here. But um you see like


that's actually me in the background and


that's not me now. That is the blurred


version of me. And um it's a horrible


interface. I would I would never release


this interface. But see that was me when


I was waving my hands uh a second ago.


But I could do all of the compression


now on uh client side so that I do


preserve privacy and put this up in the


background. And so you can imagine these


little slivers and this little


visibility into people's world as


they're kind of blogging. And in my


head, I'm like, "Okay, well, maybe this


should just be my be my blog and I'll


release this and I'll just open source


it and give it away and there doesn't


need to be a business model because this


is just fun, you know?" Like, so like


that's that's what I love about the time


we're living in, man. It's the best.


>> You just have fun.


>> You can just you could just put out


things and and sometimes though, it's


sort of interesting. It's like when when


there's not um


when you just put out projects for fun


somehow, I don't know why, but they end


up being the the the the projects that


could end up becoming the biggest


businesses.


>> You are 1,000% right. It is the weirdest


thing that I do not know how to explain.


>> Like when I when I did dig back in 2004,


it was just like I just want to see if


people can vote on things and what it


looks like when the best stuff hits the


homepage. And then, you know, a year and


a half later, there's 38 million people


a month using the site. When I made


zero, the intermittent fasting app, I


was like, I just want a way to track my


fast and like have a silly little timer.


And then, you know, the company's doing


double digits, millions of dollars in


revenue off of a little like timer app


with some other content on there. And


I'm just like, how is this even the


these were just for fun. These were, you


know, and it's it's very it's very


strange how that works.


So, uh, before we wrap up, you're you're


working on DIG and you're kind of


incubating projects. Like,


I'm listening to you and I'm like, how


can I work with Kevin? I'm sure people


are listening to this being like, this


this sounds cool. Like, how could people


support


get to work with you?


>> Yeah, I think there's a couple different


ways. I appreciate you saying that.


There's I have a um I'm sitting in an


office right now that's completely empty


and so I have an incubator here in LA, a


studio that I'm going to kind of open up


and there's just going to be free desks


for people to come in that are jamming


on really cool stuff. So if you know at


reply me or DM me on X if you you're


building really cool AI stuff and you


even if you're just coming through LA


and just want to come in and jam and it


and the point is like let's just compare


notes and talk about what's cool over


lunch and like you know if you need an


office you need a room to take a call


you got it for an hour like no big deal


right no fees or any type of like I


don't want to charge for desks or


anything like that so I'm going to


surround myself with those types of


people here in in Venice uh out in LA


and I want to do that. Um, so please


like hit me up and let's let's figure


out a way to connect if you're building


really cool stuff. Um, and then you know


I'm a venture capitalist still over at


True Ventures. And part of what I think


I think VC is going to evolve


dramatically over the next couple of


years because I I believe that people


don't need to raise capital and


oftentimes most ideas especially like


just great lifestyle businesses that get


to you know two, four, five, 10 million


in revenue like own that 100%.


Don't sell it to VCs. I'm not supposed


to be saying that because I'm a VC. And


so, but like don't do it. And so, but


that's why I hope people will realize


that like that that's why I there is a


time and place for VC. Like when you


really get to scale and you're like,


damn, I need I need a couple million


bucks to hire because the growth is so


outrageous, you know, like and and


that's that's kind of what I do and


that's why I want to play. Also, I think


VCs, the the era of VCs just being these


like MBAs that sit there and like try to


tell you how to run your business, I


think is so boring to me. I want a VC


that is playing, that's building


alongside me, that's like pressure


testing my ideas, that's a thought


partner on this stuff. And so that's


kind of like why I don't even want to


call I hate the even word venture


capital. I think it's like evil. It


feels evil these days. Um I just if I if


if someone does need first of all I try


to talk everyone out of taking money and


if they do need money especially


hardware companies need a lot of money


um then they should find someone that's


also building and that's built stuff at


scale not just because somebody has a a


great a great pedigree or you know uh


yeah does that make any sense at all? It


does. And and I just want to add like


I'm the first person to be like, you


know, people listen to me on the pod


know that I think that you should your


MVP, your business, you know, you


probably don't need venture to start.


Um, and there's some businesses that


shouldn't raise venture. But I also


think that in this world where you can


build software, MVP it, uh, if you want


to build hardware, you're like, you


build this cool piece of software, it


starts to take off and you're like, you


know, oh, there's this logical extension


to hardware, you're probably going to


need to raise money.


>> Yeah, 100%. We we invested in a company


called Sandbar that's doing this AI


ring. I don't know if you've seen the


prototypes for it.


>> Yeah.


>> Um, but it's it's really cool. And, you


know, they I can't remember how much we


put in. it was close to 10 million or


something like that. But it turns out to


do the tooling to do to to go and you


know get that to scale like that's those


those are real dollars still required to


to pull that off.


>> Totally. Kevin, it's been an absolute


treat having you on the pod. Um I hope
